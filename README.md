### What I learned

I learnt a lot working on this project. I learnt how to manipulate images to fit frame and also how to change the color of a svg file.

```html
    <div class="logo1">
      <svg width="124" height="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M5.857 18.708c1.638 0 2.995-.36 4.07-1.08 1.075-.721 1.613-1.769 1.613-3.144-.083-1.855-1.464-3.246-4.144-4.173l-1.44-.597c-.314-.1-.538-.198-.67-.298a..." fill="#25564b" fill-rule="nonzero"/></svg>
    </div>
```

```css
#stroke::after{
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    ...
}
```

```js
burgerIcon();
```



### Continued development

I defintely need to work on my navigation bar design. It doesnt seem impressive yet.
